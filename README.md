# GamePusher
GamePusher is a tool that helps you upload your builds to more game platforms, faster.

### What platforms does GamePusher upload to? ###
Steam, Oculus, itch.io.

### What does GamePusher do? ###
Every platform offers a command-line tool for uploading your game. Generally, these tools are faster and less buggy than any UI-based tools those platforms might also offer (if they offer one). However, command-line tools are scary and hard to use.

GamePusher provides a nice interface for you to specify builds and release channels and the like; it saves all the data you enter for next time *(except passwords, if you say so in Settings)*; it provides communicative error messages to help you set everything up correctly; and it runs a platform's command-line upload tools for you with the correct values.

*That's all it does.*
