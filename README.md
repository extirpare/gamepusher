# GamePusher
GamePusher is a tool for Windows that helps you upload your builds to more game platforms, faster.

### What platforms does GamePusher upload to? ###
Steam, Oculus, itch.io.

### What does GamePusher do? ###
Every gaming platform offers a command-line tool for uploading your game. These tools are faster and less buggy than UI-based tools those platforms offer (if they even have one). However, command-line tools are hard to use.

GamePusher has a nice interface where you can specify your build, release channel, and anything else offered by platforms' command line tools.
Also, it saves all the data you enter for next time *(except passwords, if you say so in Settings)*, and checks for errors.
Then, when you press 'Upload', it opens a cmd prompt already running the correct command.

*That's all it does.*
